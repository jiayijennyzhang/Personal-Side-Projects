This report gives an overview of a data-driven analysis of two separate investment approaches based on data over five years or twenty quarters: Q4 2017 to Q3 2022. The investigation took a financial approach to compare Investment in S&P 500 and investment in buying/selling company stocks, where financial formulas and techniques were applied. Data for this investigation is imported from S&P Capital IQ. The result is displayed in mathematical manner and conclusions are case-limited. This program attempts to construct a well-performed model of factors that provide higher benefits than investment on S&P 500.
This project built a multifactor model to help make better investment choices. The model suggested that the following factors are dominant factors: P/S, GP G%, Debt/EBITDA, Dividend Y%, 6M Return%. It could provide reference for both future investment considerations and future research. Although the model does have some limitations like time limitation, survivorship bias etc., it has achieved the goal of this project.
Note: This investigation used pandas on Jupiter notebook launched by Anaconda.
